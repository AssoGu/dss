Init:
On proxy node:
1) call dss_app:start(proxy,0)

On storage nodes:
1) call dss_app:start(storage,"proxy server ip")


Flow - upload/downloading from/to another storage node,
Pick one storage node
1)storage_logic:upload(FileName) to upload file, for now - make sure file is in ?LocalDBFolder
2)storage_logic:download(FileName) to download file, make sure folder ?Download_folder created.


to do - we need to create a reference to server PID and not use the actual PID, becuase the PID change every time we reset the node.
